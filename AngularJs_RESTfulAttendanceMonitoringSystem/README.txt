AUTHENTICATE USER - 
When user sign in, username and password is encrypted [ var authdata = Base64Service.encode(username + ':' + password) ] and sent as http.POST request to url
the server. Server authenticates the user credentials and returns a JSON data in the response.

INTERCEPTOR - 
Every outgoing request from the Client is intercepted and configured. If request needs authorization headers, we add it to the request.
	headers : { 
	         'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + access_token
	      }
Every incoming responseError object from the Server is also intercepted. We do so because we want to handle 401 errors due to expired
access_token so that we can renew the access_token and re-send failed request one more time. Every other responseError is forwarded to the Controller
to be handled there.
Adding refresh_token to the request 
	headers : { 
				'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + refresh_token 
			} 
JSON data received with new access_token and original refresh_token
	{
		access_token: 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJseWRpYSIsInNjb3BlcyI6WyJST0xFX0FETUlOIl0sImlzcyI6IkF1dGhvcml6YXRpb25fU2VydmVyIiwiaWF0IjoxNTY2ODUyNTkwLCJleHAiOjE1NjY4NTI2MDV9.lVO47xquwNP-M9Qha1TcoS9ErQSj9OB-d7NGOpJ7Uu9IvL53X-vX5O9GOSwzovAe83VR1D5HAsv3YGhBbXTpdg',

TOKEN EXPIRATION - 
To monitor the expiration of refresh_token, $interval service is used. It calls the method checkTokenExpiration every 1 min.
$rootScope.interval = $interval(checkTokenExpiration, 1 * 1000);
If refresh_token is expired user is logged out.



FORGOT PASSWORD - 
1. User clicks on forgot password link.
2. Front-end application (Client) returns "reset_password_link" page.
3. User submits valid email.
4. Client sends GET request to "/reset-password?email=xyz@gmail.com"
5. Server verifies email exists, generate token and send link to rest password to the email.
6. User signs into gmail account. 
7. User clicks on the link to reset password.
8. User sends GET request to "/verify-change-password-token?token=eyJ...6Ag"
9. Server verifies token validity and expiration.
10. Retrieve username from the token.
11. Retrieve employee by using that username.
12. Server returns employee to the client and client returns "change_password_form" page to the User.
13. User submits new password.
14. Client sends POST request to "/token-based-update-password" with employee = {employeeId: '', username: '', password: new_password}
15. Server verifies the employee.
16. Server encodes password using BCryptPasswordEncoder() and updates password to the database.
17. Server returns response status 200 and client returns message "Your password has been updated. Please sign in again!" to the user.

   		
   		
(NOTE: There can be multiple supervisors in a shift but there can be only one active supervisor for any shift at any given time)
EmployeeId 100, 200 and 300 are default Supervisors. They cannot be updated or disabled.
EmployeeId 400 is default Admin. It cannot be updated or disabled.
Employee whose status is inActive or disabled is cannot be updated.

## CREATE NEW ADMIN -

## DISABLE ADMIN/MEDTECH -
  1. Find admin/medtech.
  2. Disable admin/medtech.  
  
## DISABLE SUPERVISOR -

/********************* ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ***************************/ 

EMPLOYEE is a parent class. ADMIN, SUPERVISOR and MEDTECH are children class.
Therefore, ADMIN, SUPERVISOR and MEDTECH inherits properties from EMPLOYEE class.
Create a single table EMPLOYEES that can save all child objects using InheritenceType=SINGLE_TABLE.
Admin, Supervisor and Medtech can be distinguished by using DiscriminatorColumn(name='employee_type').
Employee has employee_type=0, Admin has employee_type=1, Supervisor has employee_type=2 and Medtech has employee_type=3
To persist Admin to the database, use Admin = new Admin();
To persist Supervisor to the database, use Supervisor = new Supervisor();
To persist Medtech to the database, use Medtech = new Medtech();

EMPLOYEES has many-to-many relation with EVENTS and has one-to-many relation with ROLES.
Use CascadeType.REMOVE only in relation between EMPLOYEES and ROLES as this will also remove roles if employee is removed.
Use FetchType.LAZY as it will improve performance when loading child classes.

UPDATE EMPLOYEE ??
i. ROLE CHANGED -
1. Medtech to Admin
2. Medtech to Supervisor

3. Admin to Medtech
4. Admin to Supervisor

5. Supervisor to Admin
6. Supervisor to Medtech

ii. ONLY SHIFT CHANGED -
1. Medtech to Medtech
2. Admin to Admin
3. Supervisor to Supervisor


/******** FRONT-END *********/ 
1. Employee status won't change from inactive(disabled) to active(enabled) by updating employee information. To enable employee, Admin must change 
the employee status from inactive to active. Disabled employee information cannot be updated. You must enable employee status first.

2. Always return response object from the Service.js. Do not return response.data/response.data.event/response.data.employee from the Service.js
This is because if there is a response error, you will not be able to get response.status in the Controller.js which you will need to display error message.
In Controller.js use map() function to retrieve data.
                self.list = response.data;
                self.list = self.list.map(x=> x.event);
                
3. While sending email, user can search emails by typing a letter in 'To' textbox which will display list of user emails beginning with that letter.

4. During attendance, list of active medtechs is retrieved from the database and those medtechs who attended the event are identified with 
'eventId' = 5001 and those who did not attend the event are identified as 'eventId' = 0. 

5. There are 2 ways of sending and receiving URL parameter. 
	* Using '$location'
		$location.path('/home').search({empId: String(empId)});  ---------> for sending parameter
		urlParams = $location.search().empId;                    ---------> for receiving parameter
	* Using '$routerparam'
		$location.path('/home/'+empId);                ---------> for sending parameter
		empId = parseInt($routeParams.empId);          ---------> for receiving parameter

6. Difference between data-ng-show='!ctrl.employee.enabled' and data-ng-show='ctrl.employee.enabled == false'. First one will display 
element when employee.enabled == false || employee.enabled == undefined. Second one will show element only when employee.enabled == false.

7. For file upload use 'ng-file-upload'. Follow instructions here from https://github.com/danialfarid/ng-file-upload
